# Solution Exercise 5.1

Solution to exercise where blanks in sentences shall be filled in. The filled in blanks are indicated by the use of either *italicized* format or `code` format.

## a)

Typically, `for` statements are used for counter-controlled iteration and `while` statements for sentinel-controlled iteration.

## b)

The do…while statement tests the loop-continuation condition executing *after* the loop’s body; therefore, the body always executes at least once.

## c)

When a variable’s value does not change for the entire program then it is known as *constant variable*.

## d)

When the loop-continuation condition in an iteration statement never becomes false then that loop can become an *infinite loop*.

## e)

The operator `&&` *(logical and)* can be used to ensure that two conditions are both true before choosing a certain path of execution.

## f)

If the loop-continuation condition is checked at the beginning of the loop then it is known as `while` loop.
