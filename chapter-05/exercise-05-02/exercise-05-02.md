# Solution Exercise 5.2

## a)

The body of a do..while loop always execute at least once.

## b)

The `break` statement is not required to be used after the `default case` in a `switch` statement. In fact the `break` statement can be completely left out in a switch and the code will compile, but it can be a logical error to leave out a `break` by mistake.

## c)

Logical operators enable forming of more complex combining conditions.

## d)

Execution of a loop body can be ended directly by the use of a `break` statement.
