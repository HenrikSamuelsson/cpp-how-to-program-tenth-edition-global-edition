# Solution Exercise 5.5

There are four elements part of counter controlled iteration:

1. *Control variable* that keeps track of the current value of the counter
2. *Initial value* of the control variable, a form of start point
3. *Increment* (or possibly *decrement*) of the control variable that occurs while iterating
4. *Iteration termination condition* determining end of the iteration

Note, the book uses the term *loop-continuation-condition* as the fourth element but this solution uses the reverse logic and hence another term for this element.
