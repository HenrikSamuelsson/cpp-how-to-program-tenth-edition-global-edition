# Solution Exercise 1.10

Exercise to investigate attribute of hybrid vehicles.

Vehicle categories:

- Hybrid electric vehicle, combination of combustion engine and electric motors, battery can not be charged by user, vehicle is charged by combustion engine and when breaking
- All electric vehicle, electric motors only, battery is charged by user
- Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, electric motor and combustion engine, vehicle can be fuelled with gasoline, battery can be charged by the user
- Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, a fuel cell powers an electric motor, fuelled with hydrogen
- Gasoline vehicle, combustion engine, fuelled with gasoline or similar carbon based fuel

Some attributes of vehicle batteries are:

- Nominal Voltage, the normal voltage of the battery
- Cut-off Voltage, the minimum allowable voltage that defines the empty state of the battery
- Capacity, the total Amp-hours when discharging at certain discharge current
- Energy, the total Watt-hours available when the battery is discharged at a certain discharge current
- Cycle life - number of discharge cycles the battery withstands before it degrades to be no longer usable
