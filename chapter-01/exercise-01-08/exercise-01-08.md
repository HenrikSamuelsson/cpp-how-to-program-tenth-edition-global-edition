# Solution Exercise 1.8

Exercise to test drive carbon foot print calculators and research formulas for calculating carbon footprints.

Tested a carbon foot print calculator at [Terra@pass](https://terrapass.co.uk/carbon-footprint-calculator). Did not work that great since I personally do not have any vehicle besides a bicycle and there was no option skip choosing a car.

Tested a carbon foot print calculator at [Carbonfootprint](https://terrapass.co.uk/carbon-footprint-calculator). Worked better but results seems strange because apparently I have double the carbon footprint compared to the average person in my country. And I live in a very small apartment, owns no car, and do minimal amount of travel. Probably do more shopping than the average person so this will increase my foot print.

Searched for formulas to calculate carbon foot print and found the following at [justenergy.com](https://justenergy.com/blog/how-to-calculate-your-carbon-footprint/):

1. Multiply your monthly electric bill by 105  
2. Multiply your monthly gas bill by 105  
3. Multiply your monthly oil bill by 113  
4. Multiply your total yearly mileage on your car by .79  
5. Multiply the number of flights you’ve taken in the past year (4 hours or less) by 1,100  
6. Multiply the number of flights you’ve taken in the past year (4 hours or more) by 4,400  
7. Add 184 if you do NOT recycle newspaper  
8. Add 166 if you do NOT recycle aluminum and tin  
9. Add 1-8 together for your total carbon footprint
