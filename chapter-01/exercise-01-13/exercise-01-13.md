# Solution Exercise 1.13

Exercise to discuss how a bug in programs that we developers build can cause religious extremism and terrorism.

The risk that a bug in a program would cause terrorism is most likely almost zero. Religious extremism and terrorism is due to other sources such that the resources are not spread equally between people, and that some countries have huge problems with poor leadership and corruption.

Hence when developing programs just use best practices and good craftsmanship. We can only try our best not to introduce bugs, and for any little bit bigger project there will be bugs, this is just part of life as developer.
