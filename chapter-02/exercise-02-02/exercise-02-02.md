# Solution Exercise 2.2

Exercise to state whether the below statements are true or false.

## a)

Comments cause the computer to perform an action when the program is run and they’re not ignored by the C++.

False, comments are ignored by the C++ compiler.

## b)

When a backslash is encountered in a string of characters, the next character is combined with the backslash to form an escape sequence.

True, the escape sequence is used to represent certain special characters in strings.

## c)

C++ programs begin executing from the first encountered function.

False, the starting point of a C++ program is from the special function called main.

## d)

All variables must be given a type when they’re declared.

True, but it should be noted that one can also use the keyword `auto` and then the compiler can deduce the type of a declared variable from its initialization expression.

## e)

Exactly one function in every program must be named main.

True, this will become the starting point of the program execution.

## f)

A string literal’s characters normally print exactly as they appear between the double quotes.

True, an exception is when a character comes after a backslash to form an escape sequence.

## g)

The return statement is used at the end of main.

True, although the return statement can actually also be left out and main will then by default return 0.

## h)

The arithmetic operators `*`, `/`, `%`, `+` and `–` all have the same level of precedence.

False, the three operators `*`, `/`, and `%` all share the same level of precedence, and then the operators `+` and `-` share a lower lever of precedence.

## i)

Syntax errors are also called compiler errors, compile-time errors or compilation errors, because the compiler detects them during the compilation phase.

True, a program with syntax errors will be detected by the compiler because the compiler will not be able to understand the code.
